This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles. Each folder contains all the Python solutions, and each file contains the solution for a given day. Currently migrating my python solutions from years ago to this repo, why not all solutions are available here yet.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code][aoc-about] is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles that has been running since 2015 for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. One programming puzzle a day is released from 1st to 25th December, divided in two parts (the second of which is unlocked after
solving the first). Advent of Code is created by [Eric Wastl][aoc-eric], and is 100% free. If you like Advent Of Code and want to support its creator, you can donate to him [here][aoc-support]. If you want to hang out with other fellow coders, discuss about puzzles and solutions, or just have a look around, you can join the official subreddit: [r/adventofcode][aoc-reddit].

## About this repository

I discovered Advent of Code in 2019, and played my first edition in the same year. In this repository you can find my solutions and walkthroughs for the puzzles using python syntax and learn new and interesting way of solving problems. If you are not afraid of oneliners and/or pythonic code, you are welcome to have a look at the code.
